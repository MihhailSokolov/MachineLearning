# Machine Learning
Contains several machine learning classifiers implemented in Python:
- Bayes' classifier
- k-NN classifier
- Convolutional Neural Network classifier

## Requirements
- Python 3
- NumPy
- Scikit-learn
- SciPy
- Tensorflow

## Running
To run the script, open terminal in the directory where the script is located and execute `python <script_name>.py`

**NB!** Make sure that you have installed all the required libraries before running the script.

## Results
The output of any script is accuracy of the machine learning model when tested on the validation set.

_P.S. CNN takes a lot of time to train, so be patient. During training it also outputs the current weights_
